Cross Market Analysis

The Cross Market Analysis project is designed to study and compare multiple financial markets—such as stocks, oil, and cryptocurrency—within a single analytical framework. The goal is to identify correlations, divergences, and trends across these markets to support better decision‑making and strategic insights.

🔑 Key Features
Data Integration: Collects real‑time or historical data from diverse sources (e.g., stock exchanges, crypto APIs, commodity indices).

Comparative Analysis: Evaluates performance metrics like price movements, volatility, and trading volume across markets.

Visualization: Uses interactive dashboards (built with Streamlit) to display charts, tables, and trend lines for easy interpretation.

Insights: Highlights relationships such as whether oil price fluctuations influence stock indices, or how crypto trends diverge from traditional markets.

Help users spot opportunities or risks by comparing sectors side‑by‑side.

Build a scalable framework that can be extended to new markets or indicators.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python for data processing.

Pandas & SQL for data handling and storage.
